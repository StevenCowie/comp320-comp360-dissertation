Based on an analysis of theoretical constraints, we conducted a case study which implements different balance tasks for elderly players featuring the Nintendo Wii Balance Board which encourages users to actively engage in game play. Furthermore, we tested the feasibility of the board as input device for our case study SilverBalance. Our results indicate that age-related impairments influence the use of video games among frail elderly in many respects, hence their needs have to be considered during the design process. In this context, our paper provides a foundation for future research regarding digital games for the elderly.},

	abstract = {This video presents a study on how a physical game based on a mobile robot can be used as a persuasive tool for promoting physical activity among elderly. The goal of the game is to take a ball from a robot, and afterwards try to hand it back while the robot moves. The robot records the behavior patterns of each individual player and gradually adapts the challenge of the game to the player's skill. The game was investigated in two independent field studies. The primary goal was to observe how the robot adapts to players with different mobility problems, secondly to obtain knowledge about the different play patterns and get ideas about future improvements of the game. The video shows different examples of how the elderly would play with the robot and illustrates the variety of play styles.},

	title = {Eyes-free interfaces for educational games},
	abstract = {Any new technology introduced in the classroom has a potential risk of increasing the divide for students with disabilities. This impact becomes greater as the new complexity of new technologies increases. In this sense, one of the most complex technologies currently being considered are educational video games. And while the potential benefits of video games are great also pose significant challenges from an accessibility perspective. In this paper we investigate interfaces that may facilitate access to educational games for blind students. The long-term goal is to integrate these interfaces into educational game engines or authoring tools, facilitating the adaptation of educational games to avoid a future problem of digital divide. Three eyes-free interfaces have been developed: 1) a navigation system that allows the user to browse and interact with elements using arrow and action keys; 2) a sonar that helps blind users find interactive elements in the game universe with the mouse; and 3) an interface that interprets commands typed in natural language.},

	title = {{EEG} headset supporting mobility impaired gamers with game accessibility},
	doi = {10.1109/SMC.2014.6974015},
	abstract = {Although video games have become interesting entertainment tools for millions of people, gamers with mobility impairment face difficulties to be able to interact with games successfully because of impairment conditions. Even though developers working in the area of disbility provide special games, tools, and devices support interacting with video games, there is a lack of sufficient tools and devices that are compatible with certain motor impairment conditions. EEG-headset based brain computer interface system is alternative suggested tool which can support mobility gamers by using their brain activities, facial muscles, and eye movement to interact with games. This paper aims to examine and investigate the NIA controller's capability, which use EEG-headset, with two methods providing game accessibility. The first method reduces some keyboard switches and uses the NIA controller, and the other method eliminates the entire keyboard switches and uses only the NIA controller. The result shows that playing games with using the NIA controller and one- keyboard switch is done in successful and precise way. In contrast, playing games with using only the NIA controller could be done successfully but less precisely. Our conclusion is that the NIA controller could be combined with other accessible tools to improve the accessibility of games.},
