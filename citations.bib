Furthermore, we tested the feasibility of the board as input device for our case study SilverBalance. Our results indicate that age-related impairments influence the use of video games among frail elderly in many respects, hence their needs have to be considered during the design process.

The robot records the behavior patterns of each individual player and gradually adapts the challenge of the game to the player's skill. The game was investigated in two independent field studies. The primary goal was to observe how the robot adapts to players with different mobility problems, secondly to obtain knowledge about the different play patterns and get ideas about future improvements of the game. The video shows different examples of how the elderly would play with the robot and illustrates the variety of play styles.},

	abstract = {Any new technology introduced in the classroom has a potential risk of increasing the divide for students with disabilities. This impact becomes greater as the new complexity of new technologies increases. In this sense, one of the most complex technologies currently being considered are educational video games. And while the potential benefits of video games are great also pose significant challenges from an accessibility perspective. In this paper we investigate interfaces that may facilitate access to educational games for blind students. The long-term goal is to integrate these interfaces into educational game engines or authoring tools, facilitating the adaptation of educational games to avoid a future problem of digital divide. Three eyes-free interfaces have been developed: 1) a navigation system that allows the user to browse and interact with elements using arrow and action keys; 2) a sonar that helps blind users find interactive elements in the game universe with the mouse; and 3) an interface that interprets commands typed in natural language.},

	abstract = {Although video games have become interesting entertainment tools for millions of people, gamers with mobility impairment face difficulties to be able to interact with games successfully because of impairment conditions. Even though developers working in the area of disbility provide special games, tools, and devices support interacting with video games, there is a lack of sufficient tools and devices that are compatible with certain motor impairment conditions. EEG-headset based brain computer interface system is alternative suggested tool which can support mobility gamers by using their brain activities, facial muscles, and eye movement to interact with games. This paper aims to examine and investigate the NIA controller's capability, which use EEG-headset, with two methods providing game accessibility. The first method reduces some keyboard switches and uses the NIA controller, and the other method eliminates the entire keyboard switches and uses only the NIA controller. The result shows that playing games with using the NIA controller and one- keyboard switch is done in successful and precise way. In contrast, playing games with using only the NIA controller could be done successfully but less precisely. Our conclusion is that the NIA controller could be combined with other accessible tools to improve the accessibility of games.},

However, little research has explored the practical challenges and opportunities that arise from integrating these games within existing schedules of activities in these contexts. In our work, we report on a qualitative enquiry that was conducted over a three month period at two long-term care facilities. Findings suggest that older adults enjoyed playing video games, and that games can be a valuable means of re-introducing challenge in late life, but that the impact of age-related changes and impairment can influence people’s ability to engage with games in a group setting. We outline core challenges in the design for care context and discuss implications of our work regarding the suitability of games as a self-directed leisure activity.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop a basis for the hypothesis that digital action games may produce cognitive benefits for older adults. First, a discussion of the relationship between cognitive and physical health shows the increasing weight given to the role of declines in cognition in the development of dependency in older adult population studies. Second, evidence that cognitive training produces ‘far transfer’ in elders is presented. The key issue is that one approach, known as extended practice training, has been successful in producing far transfer to memory and other processes. Its principles, which are consistent with those associated with positive brain plasticity effects, are identified. Those principles are then related to the mechanics of digital action games, which also have the important added feature of producing the experiences of presence, engagement, and flow, the subjective elements of game play that are likely to sustain interest and emotional investment in the skills practiced so that the play produces cognitive benefits. The specific cognitive abilities proposed to be improved by different types of game genres are outlined, and recent developments in game and interface design that may affect the willingness of older adults to play are described.},

Its products are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or the GNU General Public License (GPL), permitting the manufacture of Arduino boards and software distribution by anyone. Arduino boards are available commercially in preassembled form or as do-it-yourself (DIY) kits.
Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards or breadboards (shields) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs from personal computers. The microcontrollers are typically programmed using a dialect of features from the programming languages C and C++. In addition to using traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) based on the Processing language project.
The Arduino project started in 2003 as a program for students at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in Ivrea, Italy, aiming to provide a low-cost and easy way for novices and professionals to create devices that interact with their environment using sensors and actuators. Common examples of such devices intended for beginner hobbyists include simple robots, thermostats and motion detectors.
The name Arduino comes from a bar in Ivrea, Italy, where some of the founders of the project used to meet. The bar was named after Arduin of Ivrea, who was the margrave of the March of Ivrea and King of Italy from 1002 to 1014.},

In the 1970s the solderless breadboard (a.k.a. plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and nowadays the term "breadboard" is commonly used to refer to these.
Because the solderless breadboard does not require soldering, it is reusable. This makes it easy to use for creating temporary prototypes and experimenting with circuit design. For this reason, solderless breadboards are also popular with students and in technological education. Older breadboard types did not have this property. A stripboard (Veroboard) and similar prototyping printed circuit boards, which are used to build semi-permanent soldered prototypes or one-offs, cannot easily be reused. A variety of electronic systems may be prototyped by using breadboards, from small analog and digital circuits to complete central processing units (CPUs).},

	abstract = {Objectives
Age-related decline of the five classical senses (vision, smell, hearing, touch, and taste) poses significant burdens on older adults. The co-occurrence of multiple sensory deficits in older adults is not well characterized and may reflect a common mechanism resulting in global sensory impairment.

Design, Setting, and Participants
The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, a representative, population-based study of community dwelling older US adults (57-85 years of age), collected biomarkers, social and health history, and other physiological measures, including sensory function.

Measurements
We estimated the frequency with which impairment co-occurred across the five senses as an integrated measure of sensory aging. We hypothesized that multisensory deficits would be common and reflect global sensory impairment which would largely explain the effects of age, gender, and race on sensory dysfunction.

Results
Two thirds (67\%) of the older US population suffer from two or more sensory deficits, 27\% from just one, and only 6\% had none. Impairment of the sense of taste was the most common (74\%); 70\% had a poor sense of touch; 22\% had poor sense of smell; 20\% had impaired corrected vision; and 18\% had poor corrected hearing. Older adults, men, African Americans, and Hispanics had greater multisensory impairment (all P{\textless}0.01). Global sensory impairment largely accounted for the effects of age, gender, and race on the likelihood of impairment of each of the five senses.

Conclusion
Multisensory impairment is prevalent in older US adults. These data support the concept of a common process that underlies sensory aging across the five senses. Clinicians assessing patients with a sensory deficit should consider further evaluation for additional cooccurring sensory deficits.},

Demographic studies have shown that age is the best predictor of blindness and visual impairment. The most common causes of age related visual impairment in the elderly are presbyopia, cataracts, age related macular degeneration, primary open angle glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Untreated visual impairment leads to physical handicap, increased incidence of fall, depression, social isolation and dependency. Active screening for visual loss in the elderly should be part of the health examination. The elderly should be encouraged to come for formal 1-2 yearly eye assessment for early detection of visual impairment and to treat all associated problems in order to prevent permanent visual loss.},
